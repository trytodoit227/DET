	•	Guiding Questions:
	•	Does the explanation cover all the critical factors influencing the classification decision?
	•	Are any important details or factors missing from the explanation?
	•	Does the explanation provide sufficient background information to support the classification decision?
	4.	Consistency:
	•	Score 1: The explanation is completely inconsistent with the classification result.
	•	Score 2: The explanation has several inconsistencies with the classification result.
	•	Score 3: The explanation has some consistency with the classification result, but not fully.
	•	Score 4: The explanation is consistent with minor inconsistencies.
	•	Score 5: The explanation is entirely consistent with the classification result.
	•	Guiding Questions:
