Tata paid investors 608 pence a share, whereas the Brazilians final offer in an auction by the U.K.'s Takeover Panel was 603 pence. The deal triples Tata Steel's capacity to almost 28 million tons a year. Tata: \"This is the first step in showing that Indian industry can step outside its shores into an international market place as a global player.\" Corus, which was created from the merger of British Steel and Hoogovens, currently employs 47,300 people worldwide. Last year the company was the ninth-largest steel maker worldwide. The takeover may start a round of consolidation in the fragmented steel sector.\nHYPOTHESIS: Tata group was founded 70 years ago.",

Patrick Nottingham, 57, was also sentenced to 18 months house arrest and ordered to complete 150 hours of community service work. The fine represents 50% of the federal income tax Nottingham did not pay on nearly $700,000 in kickbacks he received in return for approving excessive funding to the foundation in 1999 and 2000.  In November 2005, Nottingham pleaded guilty to fraud and influence peddling and received a conditional sentence of two years less a day. \"Mr. Nottingham was not only involved in fraudulent activity, he compounded that offence by not reporting that income,\" said Crown attorney Michael Foote at a sentencing hearing earlier this week. \"He effectively committed two sets of extraordinarily serious offences.\"  Nottingham's fine is the minimum allowed by law.
